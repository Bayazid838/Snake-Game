# Snake Game

My first ever developed game using Python. I used the Tkinter module to create the UI and the Pygame library for game mechanics. I'm new to coding and look forward to making more awesome projects!

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Score tracking

## Installation

You must install Python 3 in your operating system to run this game. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://python.org). Additionally, you need to install the Pygame library. You can do this using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
3. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Screenshots

No screenshots available at this moment. (Consider adding some images of your game in action to make it more engaging.)
