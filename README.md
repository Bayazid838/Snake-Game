## Snake Game

My first ever developed game using Python. I used the Tkinter module to create the UI and the Pygame library for game mechanics. I'm new to coding and look forward to making more awesome projects!

### Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Score tracking
- Sound effects for eating and game over

### Installation

You must install Python 3 in your operating system to run this game. You can download it from the official Python website. Additionally, you need to install the Pygame library. You can do this using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### How to Play

Run the game:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to control the snake's direction.

Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.

Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

### Screenshots

No screenshots available at this moment. (Consider adding some images of your game in action to make it more engaging.)
