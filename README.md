# Snake Game

My first ever developed game using Python. I used the Tkinter module to create the UI. I'm new to coding and look forward to making more awesome projects!

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Score tracking

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
3. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
