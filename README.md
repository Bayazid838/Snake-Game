# Snake Game

My first ever developed game using Python. I used the Tkinter module to create the UI. I'm new to coding and look forward to making more awesome projects!

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Simple and intuitive UI
- Score tracking

## Installation

You must install python 3 in your operating system in order to run this file. You can do that from their official website https://python.org
I've used pygame library using cmd

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
3. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
4. Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.
